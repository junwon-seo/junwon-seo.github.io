Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. Candiate in the Department of [Materials Science and Engineering](https://www.materials.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon](https://www.cmu.edu/) advised by Professor [Anthony Rollett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rollett).

I am an ethusiastic researcher of Metal Additive Manufacturing [(AM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing), specifically Powder Bed Fusion [(PBF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_melting) of Nickel-based Superalloys. My goal is to make AM reliable and approachable enough that it can be an eco-friendly manufacturing method for everyday things.

Prior to joining Carnegie Mellon, I was an undergraduate intern at [IBS](https://www.ibs.re.kr/eng.do) (the Institute for Basic Science) in Ulsan, Korea, a post-graduate resaercher at [Max Planck Institute](https://www.mpg.de/en) in Dresden, Germany, and a machine learning Intern at [KIST](https://www.kist.re.kr/eng/index.do) (Korea Institute of Science and Technology) in Seoul, Korea.

I graduated from [Korea Universuty](https://www.korea.edu/sites/en/index.do) Department of [Materials Science and Engineering](https://mse.korea.ac.kr/index.php)), where I served as the president of an academic society [KUMUS](https://mse.korea.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=sub5_7), student representative of my class of 2020, and a member a Street Dance team [KUDT](https://www.youtube.com/c/KUDTdancers)! I was born and raised in Seoul, Korea and spent a few years in [Brisbane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane), Austraila during my elementary school years.
